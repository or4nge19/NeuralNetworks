# Convergence Theorems for Hopfield Networks

This file proves the convergence of Hopfield networks under certain conditions.
Specifically, it shows that starting from any initial state, a finite sequence of
single-neuron updates leads to a stable fixed point.

The key ideas behind the proof are:

1.  **Energy Function:** The Hopfield network has an energy function that decreases
  whenever a neuron's state is updated.

2.  **Finite State Space:** The state space of the Hopfield network is finite.

3.  **No Infinite Descending Chains:** In a finite state space, it is impossible to
  have an infinite strictly decreasing chain of energy values.

4.  **Well-Foundedness:** The energy order is well-founded, meaning there are no
  infinite descending chains.

5.  **Convergence:** By well-founded induction on the energy order, we can show that
  starting from any initial state, there is a finite sequence of updates that leads
  to a stable fixed point.
  This convergence result relies on the assumption that all thresholds are zero,
  i.e., `(h_threshold_zero : ∀ j, net.thresholds j = 0)`.

## Key Definitions

*   `HopfieldState`: Represents the state of the Hopfield network, i.e., the spin
  configuration of all neurons.
*   `HopfieldNetwork`: Represents the Hopfield network, including the weight matrix
  and thresholds.
*   `energy`: The energy function of the Hopfield network.
*   `updateState`: Updates the state of a single neuron in the network.
*   `UpdateSeq`: A namespace for defining functions and lemmas related to sequences
  of neuron updates.
*   `isFixedPoint`: Checks if a given state is a fixed point of the network, i.e.,
  no single-neuron update can change the state.

## Main Results

*   `energy_strict_decrease`: The energy strictly decreases if we actually flip the
  i-th spin.
*   `no_infinite_descending_chain`: A strictly decreasing chain in a finite set is
  impossible.
*   `energy_wf`: Well‐foundedness of the `energy_order`: any infinite descending
  chain in energy would require infinitely many distinct states from a finite set,
  which is impossible.
*   `convergence`: Main convergence theorem: from any initial state `x₀`, there is
  a finite sequence of single-neuron updates leading to a stable fixed point.

  `energy_strict_decrease` proves that the energy of a Hopfield network strictly decreases
  when the state is updated at a specific neuron `i`, given that the update changes the state,
  all thresholds are zero, and the local field at neuron `i` is non-zero.

  Assumptions:
  - `net : HopfieldNetwork n`: The Hopfield network under consideration.
  - `x : HopfieldState n`: The current state of the network.
  - `i : Fin n`: The index of the neuron being updated.
  - `h_threshold_zero : ∀ j, net.thresholds j = 0`: All thresholds of the network are zero.
  - `h_not_fixed : updateState net x i ≠ x`: Updating the state at neuron `i` changes the state.

  The proof proceeds by showing that the difference in energy between the updated state and the
  current state is equal to the energy difference at neuron `i` (energyDiff net x i).
  It then suffices to show that this energy difference is negative.

  The proof uses `energy_strictly_decreasing_if_state_changes_and_localField_nonzero` to show that
  the energy strictly decreases if the state changes and the local field is non-zero.
  The condition that the state changes is given by `h_not_fixed`.
  The condition that the local field is non-zero is proven by contradiction: assuming the local field
  is zero leads to the conclusion that the update does not change the state, contradicting `h_not_fixed`.

  `state_space_finite n` proves that the state space of a Hopfield network with `n` neurons is finite.
  It leverages the fact that `HopfieldState n` is equivalent to `Fin n → SpinState`, which represents the set of all functions from `Fin n` to `SpinState`.
  Since both `Fin n` and `SpinState` are finite, the set of all functions between them is also finite, as shown by `Pi.finite`.

## Lemma: no_infinite_descending_chain

This lemma proves that there cannot be an infinite descending chain of energy states in a Hopfield network.
In other words, there is no infinite sequence of states where the energy strictly decreases at each step.

**Arguments:**

*   `net : HopfieldNetwork n`: The Hopfield network.

**Returns:**

*   `¬ (∃ (f : ℕ → HopfieldState n), ∀ k, energy_order net (f (k+1)) (f k))`:
  It is not the case that there exists a function `f` from natural numbers to Hopfield states
  such that for all `k`, the energy of the state `f (k+1)` is strictly less than the energy of the state `f k`.

**Proof:**

1.  **Assume** there exists an infinite descending chain `f`.
2.  **Show** that since the state space is finite, the sequence `f` must revisit some state, i.e., there exist `i` and `j` such that `i < j` and `f i = f j`. This is done using the pigeonhole principle.
3.  **Show** that `energy net (f j) = energy net (f i)` because `f j = f i`.
4.  **Show** that there is a strict descent from `energy net (f i)` to `energy net (f j)` using induction on the difference between `i` and `j`.
5.  **Contradiction**: We have both `energy net (f j) = energy net (f i)` and `energy net (f j) < energy net (f i)`, which is impossible.
6.  **Therefore**, the initial assumption of an infinite descending chain must be false.

**Main Theorem**
`convergence` proves that a Hopfield network with zero thresholds will always converge to a stable state.

Given a Hopfield network `net` of size `n` and an initial state `x₀`, if all thresholds are zero,
then there exists a stable state `y` and a path (list of indices) such that:
1. `y` is a fixed point of the update sequence (i.e., no single neuron update changes the state).
2. `y` can be reached from `x₀` by applying the updates in the order specified by the `path`.

The proof uses well-founded induction on the energy function of the network.
The energy function strictly decreases with each state update (given zero thresholds) until a fixed point is reached.
